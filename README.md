# PicImg - Image Gallery
Hello, and welcome to my latest project, where I delve into various aspects of web development. 
In this project, I have utilized React to build the frontend. While it is not fully responsive at the moment, 
I plan to implement responsiveness in the near future. 

On the backend, I have employed Express.js (Node.js) and utilized MongoDB for the database. 
This web application allows users to explore and upload images, as well as save them to their personal collections. 
I have also ensured that user login credentials are securely hashed.
